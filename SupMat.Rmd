**Fig. S`r i`. Benthic cover (%) from 1994-2022 at each reef for macroalgae at recovering reefs (a) and hard coral at shifted reefs (b).** Points are the mean benthic cover across sites (Â± 2 * standard error), and grey lines are site-level cover values. Dashed line is the mean pre-bleaching benthic cover in 1994.

```

**Fig. S`r i`. Euclidean distance of recovering (blue) and regime-shifted (red) reefs from 1994-2022.** Points are mean Euclidean distance among all reefs in each survey year shown against (a) hard coral cover (%) and (b) macroalgae cover (%), connected through time with lines.
